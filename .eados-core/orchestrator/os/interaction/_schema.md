# `interaction.yaml` — schema

The **interaction policy** as data (M17 / ADR-0022, issue #277). The other eight specs govern
*what* the agent may do — workflow, authority, git, contribution, routing; this one governs **how
it communicates while doing it**: when a claim must carry a confidence tag, which courtesy openers
are banned, how to disagree with the maintainer, and what pushback may — and may not — change.
Source: the owner-provided interaction ruleset of 2026-07-11, adopted **transformed, not verbatim**
([ADR-0022](../../../docs/adr/0022-interaction-policy-as-data.md) records every delta as a
disposition table). Precedent: risk-weights-as-data ([`../risk/_schema.md`](../risk/_schema.md)),
routing (ADR-0017).

**Enforcement ceiling — stated honestly.** Three tiers: *instruct* (live chat — no gate can verify
a conversation turn; the contract surfaces rendered from this data, M17 17.2, instruct the agent),
*verify* (on-disk artifacts — lint today: `os-spec-completeness` + `data-file-validity`; the
`interaction-lockstep` gate lands with 17.3 to keep prose and data congruent), *re-ground* (the
M14 runtime hooks re-inject the posture, 17.4). A host's own system
prompt sits above `AGENTS.md`; the contract applies where the host permits. Claiming more than
instruct / verify / re-ground would be dishonest (ADR-0015/0016 posture).

`eados_lint` (`os-spec-completeness`) requires the instance to define every key below;
`data-file-validity` requires it to parse.

## Required structure

```yaml
version:            # integer schema version
confidence:         # the calibration vocabulary and its evidence criteria
  levels:           # ordered confidence tags, strongest -> weakest evidence
  criteria:         # per-level evidence criterion - what earns the tag
    certain:        # verified this session or an in-repo fact, cited
    likely:         # an inference from named evidence, the evidence stated
    guessing:       # gap-filling without evidence, flagged where it is made
  scope:            # what gets tagged - load-bearing claims, not every sentence
  mostly_guessing:  # the reply-level rule - a mostly-guessed reply says so first
sycophancy:         # the denylist (data, config-overridable) and the opening rule it backs
  opening_rule:     # the positive rule - most informative statement first, never courtesy
  banned_openers:   # literal phrases that never open a reply
  banned_classes:   # phrase classes suppressed anywhere: id -> meaning
dissent:            # structured disagreement - the ADR pattern applied to conversation
  template:         # reason / alternative / specific risk, the three required parts
  ordering:         # uncomfortable answer first
  warm_up:          # no warm-up prose
pushback:           # claims follow the evidence; decisions follow the human
  on_pushback:      # re-verify the evidence before answering
  hold_claim:       # hold a claim only while the evidence still supports it
  concede:          # concede explicitly when wrong
  human_decision:   # precedence layer 1 - comply and record the dissent
```

## Confidence — evidence criteria and scope

Every level is *earned by evidence*, not by tone: `certain` means verified this session or an
in-repo fact — cite the file, command, or test; `likely` means an inference from named evidence —
state what it rests on; `guessing` means gap-filling — it must be flagged at the point it is made,
and a reply that is mostly guessing says so **first**. The `scope` rule is the hardening that makes
the vocabulary usable: tag **load-bearing claims** — recommendations, risk calls, decision-driving
facts — not every sentence; per-sentence tagging is noise and false precision.

The vocabulary aligns with interview provenance (#169): `guessing` is the conversational analogue
of a manifest answer whose provenance is `defaulted` (glossed *assumed* — taken from the
questionnaire default and echoed back at confirmation). Both mark unverified gap-fill; both are
flagged rather than silently blended into verified fact.

## Sycophancy — a denylist with a stated ceiling

`banned_openers` and `banned_classes` are data, not prose, so the contract surfaces (17.2) render
one list and the 17.3 lockstep gate can keep them congruent. **Honest caveat:** a model can route
around a denylist — the list suppresses the worst offenders; the `opening_rule` and the posture
rules in `dissent`/`pushback` do the rest. The transformed source rule 1 is deliberate: the rule is
*most informative statement first*, **not** *disagree first* — forced contrarianism is as
uncalibrated as flattery (ADR-0022).

**Override surface.** The list is tunable without editing the core: a same-name overlay
`config/interaction.yaml` may replace or extend the `sycophancy:` denylist and tune the
`confidence:` wording, exactly like the persona overlays under `config/agents/` — see
[`../../../config/README.md`](../../../config/README.md). The `dissent:` and `pushback:`
protocol blocks are the contract, not overlay surface — changing them is a core edit recorded by
an ADR; `pushback.human_decision` in particular never relaxes (precedence layer 1 sits above
every spec — [`../README.md`](../README.md)).

## Dissent — the ADR pattern applied to conversation

Disagreement carries the same three parts an ADR carries: the position (*reason*), the alternative
(*what I would do instead*), and the consequence (*the specific downside of the other path*). The
uncomfortable answer is the **first line, not paragraph three**, and there is no warm-up prose.
Escalation beyond the conversation follows the authority ladder
([`../authority/authority.yaml`](../authority/authority.yaml)); once the human decides, the
dissent is recorded and never relitigated — until then, a standing factual claim is governed by
the pushback block below.

## Pushback — claims vs decisions

The transformed source rule 7. An absolute "don't fold" entrenches errors; a reflexive fold is
sycophancy by another name. The split: a factual **claim** follows the evidence — on pushback,
*re-verify* (do not restate from memory), hold the claim only while the evidence still supports
it, and concede **explicitly** when it does not. A human **decision** is precedence layer 1
([`../README.md`](../README.md)): comply and record the dissent — never relitigate.

## Invariants

- `confidence.criteria` defines exactly the `confidence.levels` entries; the levels are ordered
  strongest → weakest evidence. A tag never appears without meeting its criterion — an unearned
  `certain` is a policy violation, not a style choice.
- The denylist is data: an overlay (`config/interaction.yaml`, highest-precedence layer of the
  [customization overlays](../../../config/README.md)) may replace or extend `sycophancy.*` and
  tune `confidence.*` wording — and nothing else: the `dissent:`/`pushback:` protocol blocks are
  not overlay surface, and **no overlay relaxes `pushback.human_decision`** — the human terminal
  gate (`AGENTS.md` §6) sits above every spec, this one included.
- **Generic interaction core only.** Per-activity interaction shapes (review / debug / optimize)
  live in the commands and personas that own those activities (M8, M15) — declined here to keep
  EADOS from drifting toward a prompt library (ADR-0022, RFC-0001 identity).
- English on disk (`AGENTS.md` §2); the instance carries a top-level integer `version:`.
- Live conversation is *instructed*, never *gated* — only on-disk artifacts are verified. Stating
  otherwise anywhere in the OS is a documentation bug (the ADR-0022 enforcement ceiling).
