# Roadmap — EADOS

The **single source of truth** for EADOS's own delivery plan, from start to finish.
[RFC-0001](0001-eados-delivery-os.md) ratifies the design and points here for the schedule.

- **Living & checkbox-driven.** When an item completes in a PR, flip its checkbox
  (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) **in the same PR**. New work goes at the bottom of its milestone with a
  fresh `<milestone>.<task>` number; never renumber.
- **Versioning:** pre-1.0, milestone-driven (`AGENTS.md` §6).
- **Invariant:** the factory keeps working unchanged throughout; every phase is opt-in, so a
  user who only wants `scaffold` (today's generation) sees no behavior change.
- **Foundation:** [RFC-0001](0001-eados-delivery-os.md) + the machine-readable specs under
  [`orchestrator/os/`](../../orchestrator/os/README.md).

## Milestone 1 — Foundation: domain axis, persistent manifest, role authority, `/eados init`

**Goal.** Lay the data foundation the whole pipeline reads from, and the entry command — without
changing how generation behaves today.

- [x] 1.1 Add the **domain/target axis** as data: `orchestrator/domains/_schema.md` +
      `_template.yaml`, and seeds `software.yaml`, `game.yaml`, `mobile.yaml` (each declaring its
      roles, artifacts — GDD vs PRD, NFR axes — RAM/GPU/framerate for `game`, and milestone
      vocabulary — Alpha/Beta/RC vs SemVer).
- [x] 1.2 `eados_lint`: a **`domain-completeness`** gate (every `domains/<d>.yaml` defines every
      schema key), mirroring `profile-completeness`.
- [x] 1.3 Interview: new **`Q0.4 — development target`** loads the domain profile; the manifest
      gains a `domain` field.
- [x] 1.4 Promote the manifest to a **persistent, reference-based `delivery_state`** block
      (current phase, checkpoints, cross-link ids) with a `schema_version` (**resolves OQ1**).
- [x] 1.5 Wire the **authority block** to the existing roles (persona in `agent/*.md` ↔ authority
      in `authority.yaml`), making the persona≠authority separation real.
- [x] 1.6 Ship the **`/eados init`** command surface (entry skill) + a thin state-driven
      phase-runner skeleton that reads `workflow.yaml` and reports the legal next transitions.

**Acceptance gate.** All lints green (incl. `domain-completeness`); render-smoke unchanged; a
chosen domain selects roles/artifacts/NFRs/milestone-vocabulary purely as data.
**Depends on:** RFC-0001, `orchestrator/os/` specs.

---

## Milestone 2 — `design` phase (RFC) + Product/Delivery roles + workflow checker + authority gate

**Goal.** Make the first governance phase real: author/import RFCs under a review protocol, with
the new org-chart roles and the deterministic engine that gates phase transitions.

- [x] 2.1 Add personas `agent/{product-manager,tech-lead,producer}.md` + the **domain-overlay**
      pattern (`agent/domains/<domain>/<role>.md`, e.g. the `game` `product-manager` = Game
      Designer); recursive `agent-registry` + `authority-personas` lints. **OQ4 resolved:** one
      authority role + a domain-specialized persona overlay (not two role IDs).
- [x] 2.2 RFC template + the **RFC-review protocol** under `orchestrator/os/rfc/` (schema +
      config + template + protocol), and `tools/rfc_check.py` enforcing the **`rfc-approved`** gate
      (required sections + a `tech-lead` approval record).
- [x] 2.3 The **deterministic workflow checker**: `phase_runner.py` returns the legal transitions
      and (new `--propose <to>`) validates a proposed transition and **emits the checkpoint** to
      write — read-only; the agent writes it, the human confirms H-gates.
- [x] 2.4 The **authority gate** — `tools/authority_check.py <role> <paths>` enforces the
      `authority.yaml` ownership map: a path the acting role may not write (outside its
      `owns`/`may_draft`) is rejected. Agent-invoked (CI can't know the actor's role), tested.
- [x] 2.5 Ship the **`/eados design`** command surface (`commands/design.md` — authority-check →
      author the RFC from the template → review → `rfc_check` → `phase_runner --propose plan`).

**Acceptance gate.** A sample RFC passes the review gate; an out-of-authority edit is rejected by
the authority gate; the checker computes the correct legal transitions for a given state.
**Depends on:** M1.

---

## Milestone 3 — `plan` phase: roadmap from RFCs + the traceability graph

**Goal.** Co-create the roadmap from RFCs through a real negotiation, and build the lineage graph
that makes delivery auditable.

- [x] 3.1 The **roadmap-negotiation protocol** under `orchestrator/os/plan/` (schema + `plan.yaml`
      config + `negotiation-protocol.md`): PM proposes → `tech-lead` sizes (T-shirt) → `producer`
      reconciles capacity, anchored to artifacts (no "multi-agent theatre").
- [x] 3.2 Ship the **`/eados plan`** command surface (`commands/plan.md` — negotiate via `plan.yaml`
      → write `ROADMAP.md` → `traceability.py` (`roadmap-covers-rfcs`) → `--propose scaffold`).
- [x] 3.3 The **traceability-graph builder** — `tools/traceability.py` builds the design-time
      `RFC → milestone` edges from the roadmap (the Git-side `PR → commit → release` edges land in
      M4, derived from the `git`-spec cross-links).
- [x] 3.4 The **`roadmap-covers-rfcs`** gate — `traceability.py` fails when an RFC is addressed by
      no milestone (every RFC maps to ≥1 milestone; generalizes the spec-coverage-map). Wired into
      `workflow.yaml`.

**Acceptance gate.** Every RFC maps to ≥1 milestone; the graph builds from a sample project's
cross-links.
**Depends on:** M2.

---

## Milestone 4 — `audit` phase: risk scoring + enforced `traceability-lint`

**Goal.** Stand up continuous audit with a real risk model, and turn the traceability graph into
a blocking gate.

- [x] 4.1 A **risk model** — `tools/risk_score.py` + the `risk` OS spec: score = f(security surface
      × change size × blast radius), generalizing the `reviewer` + `security-auditor` roles.
- [x] 4.2 Ship the **`/eados audit`** command surface (`commands/audit.md` — `traceability-lint` +
      `risk_score` → the `security-auditor` gate above threshold → a risk register).
- [x] 4.3 The **`traceability-lint`** gate — `traceability.py --links` extends the graph to the
      Git-side edges (`milestone → PR → commit → release`) and fails on a dangling edge (an RFC with
      no PR, a PR missing its RFC/milestone, a release not tracing to a PR + commit).
- [x] 4.4 Risk-threshold → **mandatory `security-auditor` gate** at/above the level; the threshold
      is **per-domain configurable** in `risk.yaml` (**OQ2 resolved**: a global default + domain override).

**Acceptance gate.** A seeded dangling edge fails `traceability-lint`; a change above the risk
threshold forces the security gate.
**Depends on:** M3.

---

## Milestone 5 — `refactor` (brownfield) — last, sandboxed

**Goal.** Bring an existing repository up to the standard via incremental, gated migrations —
the highest-risk phase (it edits real user code), so it is sequenced last and write-contained.

- [x] 5.1 **Brownfield reader** — `tools/brownfield.py` (READ-ONLY) maps an existing repo against
      the EADOS standard (agent contract, docs system, CI, source tree) and reports the gaps to migrate.
- [x] 5.2 **Migration planner** — `tools/migration_planner.py` (READ-ONLY) orders the brownfield
      gaps into incremental steps (one logical change each), lowest-risk / most-foundational first.
- [x] 5.3 A **write-contained sandbox** — `tools/sandbox.py` (defense-in-depth, on the renderer
      write-guard principle of [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-renderer-write-guards-and-validation-independence.md)):
      a write may only land inside the target repo (traversal/absolute/symlink/`.git`/clobber refused).
- [x] 5.4 Ship the **`/eados refactor`** command surface (`commands/refactor.md` — brownfield read
      → plan → sandboxed, gated, **additive** migration PRs, one logical change each).

**Acceptance gate.** A fixture repo is migrated via gated PRs; no write escapes the sandbox; each
PR passes the standard's gates.
**Depends on:** M4.

---

## Milestone 6 — hardening & UX (post-v2.0.0)

**Goal.** Close the automation/completeness gaps (G2–G4) and feature suggestions (F1–F4) surfaced
by the v2.0.0 enterprise review, plus the one cross-spec scope deferred from #62 — **without
changing the shipped pipeline's behavior**. Each item is one logical change (one PR), tracked as a
GitHub issue under the `M6 — hardening & UX` milestone (#6).

- [x] 6.1 (G4, #65) **End-to-end phase smoke test** — a fixture that runs a complete *phase flow*
      (`design → plan → audit`) over the real tool CLIs to catch tool-integration bugs the per-tool
      unit tests miss: each gate passes on a coherent fixture and fails on a broken one, and
      `phase_runner --propose` matches every transition declared in `workflow.yaml`
      (`tools/tests/test_phase_smoke.py`).
- [x] 6.2 (F3, #68) **Risk-model weights as data** — the factor weights, blast-radius threshold, and
      points→level cutoffs move from `risk_score.py` into `risk.yaml`, each **per-domain overridable**
      like `mandatory_gate_level`; the scorer reads them via `resolve(cfg, domain)` with built-in
      fallbacks (back-compat, default scores unchanged). Full "knowledge as data"; `risk/_schema.md` updated.
- [x] 6.3 (G2, #63) **Single-artifact render for `refactor`** — `tools/render_artifact.py` renders
      one template with the manifest context (the same gates as a full render) and places it via
      `sandbox.safe_write`; the "render the missing artifact → sandbox" step in `refactor.md` now
      invokes it (no longer manual).
- [x] 6.4 (F1, #66) **`/eados status` (doctor)** — a read-only `tools/doctor.py` (+ the
      `commands/status.md` surface) reports current phase, legal transitions (+ gates/human-gating),
      refs, and traceability coverage at a glance — composing `phase_runner` + `traceability`; exits
      non-zero on an actionable problem (undeclared phase, uncovered RFC, dangling edge).
- [x] 6.5 (G3, #64) **Thin CLI phase orchestrator** — `tools/eados.py <phase> <manifest>` runs a
      phase's deterministic outgoing gates (data-driven from `workflow.yaml`), marking render-time /
      human gates `[manual]`, then reports the legal next moves; `eados.py status` is the doctor. The
      executable spine beneath the markdown `/eados <phase>` procedures.
- [x] 6.6 (F2, #67) **Auto-derive traceability links from PR bodies** (via `gh`) —
      `tools/derive_links.py` builds the `{pr, rfc, milestone, commit, release}` edges from merged
      PRs (pure parser + a thin `gh` shell that degrades cleanly offline), emitting a `links.yaml`
      `traceability-lint` consumes — no more hand-writing it.
- [x] 6.7 (F4, #69) **Version-lockstep dogfooding** — a new `version-lockstep` gate in `eados_lint`
      asserts every EADOS README release badge (EN + i18n) and the CHANGELOG's "latest is" prose
      match the CHANGELOG's latest released `## [X.Y.Z]` — the factory held to the bar it imposes
      downstream.
- [x] 6.8 (#72) **Cross-spec gate → cross-cutting gates** — `traceability-lint` is now registered in
      `workflow.yaml`'s gate list (cross-cutting, `required_for: []`) and `cross-spec-consistency`
      validates `git.yaml`'s `traceability.gate` against it, so a typo'd cross-cutting gate id is
      caught too (the scope deferred from #62). **Closes M6.**
- [x] 6.9 (#76) **Auto-sync shared action pins into templates** — `tools/sync_action_pins.py`
      (`--check` / `--fix`) rewrites the rendered workflow templates' action pins to the factory CI's,
      so a Dependabot `github-actions` bump needs no manual companion edit to pass the `action-pins`
      lockstep gate (ADR-0009) — and the `dependabot-pin-sync` workflow (`workflow_run`, not
      `pull_request_target`; ADR-0013) applies it automatically on a Dependabot PR (true zero-touch).

**Acceptance gate.** Each item lands as a gated PR with tests; no regression to the v2.0.0 pipeline;
any new data/spec is `_schema`-validated and lint-gated (no special-casing in code — the
anti-fragmentation invariant below).
**Depends on:** v2.0.0 (post-release); incremental — items are independent.

---

## Milestone 7 — onboarding & UX docs (post-v2.1.0)

**Goal.** Close the first-time-user friction a fresh install/usage evaluation surfaced (2026-06-27):
make the phase pipeline followable, the install OS-agnostic, the manifest self-documenting, and a
correct-but-confusing tool output self-explanatory — **without changing any tool behavior** (docs,
inline comments, and at most an optional tool hint). Each item is one PR, tracked under the
`M7 — onboarding & docs` milestone (#7).

- [x] 7.1 (#89) **Prerequisites — getting an AI coding agent** — a short pointer (not a tutorial):
      install links for Claude Code / Gemini Antigravity / ChatGPT Codex, one line on what "open the
      folder" does (auto-loads `AGENTS.md`), and the explicit no-agent fallback to the deterministic
      path — so nobody stalls before starting.
- [x] 7.2 (#88) **Windows/PowerShell install & render variants** — a PowerShell equivalent beside
      every Unix snippet in README/USAGE (download, extract, render), using `$env:TEMP` not `/tmp`,
      so a Windows user reaches `<repo>/.eados-core/` without translation.
- [x] 7.3 (#90) **`project.yaml` documented field-by-field** — inline comments in the template and/or
      a required-fields table (field → meaning → required? → source → placeholder), so a manifest can
      be hand-filled without reverse-engineering `reference.yaml`; `render.py` succeeds on it.
- [x] 7.4 (#87) **End-to-end phase walkthrough** — a narrated `init → design → plan → scaffold →
      audit` run (the headline v2.0.0 feature) with the exact commands, expected output, the human
      gates, and how `delivery_state` evolves; reproducible from the doc alone.
- [x] 7.5 (#91) **Clarify `rfc_check` scope** — a doc note (+ optionally a clearer tool hint) that the
      gate targets generated-project RFCs following `os/rfc/template.md`; EADOS's own RFC-0001 is
      intentionally out of scope, so its FAIL isn't mistaken for a defect (no headings retrofitted).

**Acceptance gate.** A first-time user can, from the docs alone, install on any OS, understand the
agent prerequisite (or take the no-agent path), hand-fill a valid manifest, and follow a full phase
run. **No tool behavior change**; self-lint + render-smoke stay green.
**Depends on:** v2.1.0 (post-release); incremental — items are independent.

---

## Milestone 8 — inbound contribution review: `/eados review` + the `contribution-reviewer` role

**Goal.** Give EADOS (and every generated repo) a governed way to **triage and review pull requests
opened by non-owners** — the inbound-contribution funnel the existing *internal* `reviewer` /
`security-auditor` roles do not cover (those are author-agnostic peer review of a diff). A new
`contribution-reviewer` role **composes** those two and adds the dimensions specific to an untrusted,
non-owner contribution: **provenance / trust tier** (owner · collaborator · external-fork),
**contribution-policy compliance** (sign-off, Conventional Commits, the `git.yaml` PR↔RFC↔milestone
cross-links, one-logical-change), **untrusted-code security posture** (a fork can't reach CI secrets;
a workflow-file change is a poisoned-pipeline surface; new deps are supply-chain), **authority /
scope** (a non-owner holds no authority role, so a touch on an owned path escalates to the
maintainer), and **triage / disposition** (label, route to the owning internal role, recommend
approve-with-nits / request-changes / needs-maintainer / re-implement-in-house / close-with-thanks).
It **recommends and drafts; it never merges** — the `pr.merged_by: human` boundary is untouched.
`/eados review` is **cross-cutting** (usable in any phase, like `/eados status`), not a new state in
the workflow machine. Each item is one PR, tracked under the `M8 — inbound contribution review`
milestone.

This milestone **automates the policy the owner already applies by hand** to external PRs (verify the
change, not the person; honor a good idea via co-author + an in-house re-implementation; the owner
posts the close — the #94 episode), encoding it as data the gates validate.

- [x] 8.1 **Contribution policy as data** — `orchestrator/os/contribution/{_schema.md,
      contribution.yaml}`: the owner-identity source (CODEOWNERS / manifest), the trust tiers
      (owner · collaborator · external-fork), the required inbound checks, the disposition + label
      vocabulary, and the "external touches an owned path → escalate" rule. Auto-validated by
      `os-spec-completeness` and the `data-file-validity` / `gate-coverage` gates; its role/gate
      cross-refs validated by `cross-spec-consistency` (anti-fragmentation — no special case in code).
- [x] 8.2 **The `contribution-reviewer` role** — persona `agent/contribution-reviewer.md` (the
      enterprise contribution steward: composes `reviewer` + `security-auditor`, adds
      provenance / policy / triage, never merges) + an `authority.yaml` record (engineering pillar,
      `phases: []`, empty `owns` / `may_approve` like `reviewer`) + a registry row. Enforced by
      `agent-registry` + `authority-personas`.
- [ ] 8.3 **`tools/pr_review.py` — the inbound-PR evaluator** — given a PR number, via `gh` and
      degrading cleanly offline (the `derive_links.py` pattern): fetch author + fork status + files +
      commits + check status → **classify non-owner authorship** → run the 8.1 policy checks →
      compose `authority_check.py` (owned-path escalation) + `risk_score.py` (security / size /
      blast) → emit a structured **review report + recommended disposition**. Pure parser + a thin
      `gh` shell, fixture-tested.
- [ ] 8.4 **`/eados review <PR#>` command surface** — `commands/review.md` + a `commands/README.md`
      row: run `pr_review.py` → on an owned-path touch or a REQUIRED risk score, invoke the
      `security-auditor` + `reviewer` → **draft** the review comment + labels via `gh` → recommend a
      disposition. Cross-cutting like `/eados status` (not a phase transition). Boundary: drafts only;
      the human requests-changes / approves / merges.
- [ ] 8.5 **Wire the inbound checks as a cross-cutting gate** — a `contribution-review` gate in
      `workflow.yaml` (`required_for: []`, like `traceability-lint`), referenced from a new `git.yaml`
      `pr` field + its `_schema.md`, validated by `cross-spec-consistency`. **No change to the shipped
      phase pipeline.** Optional: a rendered CI template `pr-contribution-review.yml` (comment-only —
      never approve / merge) for generated repos.
- [ ] 8.6 **Dogfood + docs** — an ADR for the inbound-contribution-trust model, a `/eados review`
      walkthrough in USAGE/README, and the evaluator run against the **#94** external-contribution
      episode (the canonical case) as the worked example — plus the currently-open non-owner PR #96
      as a live secondary case; RFC-0001, this roadmap, the affected specs, and the CHANGELOG kept in
      lockstep (the cross-cutting invariant).

**Acceptance gate.** A PR from a non-owner produces a structured report + a recommended disposition;
an external PR touching an owned path is flagged for maintainer escalation; the human boundary (no
agent merge) is preserved; self-lint (incl. the gate-coverage trilogy) + render-smoke stay green.
**Depends on:** M7 (post-merge); ships to consumers in the bundle → a likely **v2.2.0** release.

---

## Cross-cutting invariants (every PR, every milestone)

These are **not tasks to complete** but **invariants upheld in every PR** — held across M1–M5 and
the v2.0.0 release, and binding on all future work (M6 included). They are deliberately not checkboxes.

- **English on disk; agent drafts / human merges & publishes; Conventional Commits; one logical
  change per PR; one PR at a time.**
- **Each new spec / role / domain ships `_schema`-validated and lint-gated** — never a special case
  in code (anti-fragmentation), enforced by `eados_lint`'s `os-spec-completeness`,
  `domain-completeness`, `authority-personas`, and `agent-registry` gates.
- **Each milestone keeps RFC-0001, this roadmap, the affected specs, and the `CHANGELOG` in sync in
  the same PR.**
