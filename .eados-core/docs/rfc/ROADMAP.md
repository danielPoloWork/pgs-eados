# Roadmap — EADOS

The **single source of truth** for EADOS's own delivery plan, from start to finish.
[RFC-0001](0001-eados-delivery-os.md) ratifies the design and points here for the schedule.

- **Living & checkbox-driven.** When an item completes in a PR, flip its checkbox
  (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) **in the same PR**. New work goes at the bottom of its milestone with a
  fresh `<milestone>.<task>` number; never renumber.
- **Versioning:** pre-1.0, milestone-driven (`AGENTS.md` §6).
- **Invariant:** the factory keeps working unchanged throughout; every phase is opt-in, so a
  user who only wants `scaffold` (today's generation) sees no behavior change.
- **Foundation:** [RFC-0001](0001-eados-delivery-os.md) + the machine-readable specs under
  [`orchestrator/os/`](../../orchestrator/os/README.md).

## Milestone 1 — Foundation: domain axis, persistent manifest, role authority, `/eados init`

**Goal.** Lay the data foundation the whole pipeline reads from, and the entry command — without
changing how generation behaves today.

- [x] 1.1 Add the **domain/target axis** as data: `orchestrator/domains/_schema.md` +
      `_template.yaml`, and seeds `software.yaml`, `game.yaml`, `mobile.yaml` (each declaring its
      roles, artifacts — GDD vs PRD, NFR axes — RAM/GPU/framerate for `game`, and milestone
      vocabulary — Alpha/Beta/RC vs SemVer).
- [x] 1.2 `eados_lint`: a **`domain-completeness`** gate (every `domains/<d>.yaml` defines every
      schema key), mirroring `profile-completeness`.
- [x] 1.3 Interview: new **`Q0.4 — development target`** loads the domain profile; the manifest
      gains a `domain` field.
- [x] 1.4 Promote the manifest to a **persistent, reference-based `delivery_state`** block
      (current phase, checkpoints, cross-link ids) with a `schema_version` (**resolves OQ1**).
- [x] 1.5 Wire the **authority block** to the existing roles (persona in `agent/*.md` ↔ authority
      in `authority.yaml`), making the persona≠authority separation real.
- [x] 1.6 Ship the **`/eados init`** command surface (entry skill) + a thin state-driven
      phase-runner skeleton that reads `workflow.yaml` and reports the legal next transitions.

**Acceptance gate.** All lints green (incl. `domain-completeness`); render-smoke unchanged; a
chosen domain selects roles/artifacts/NFRs/milestone-vocabulary purely as data.
**Depends on:** RFC-0001, `orchestrator/os/` specs.

---

## Milestone 2 — `design` phase (RFC) + Product/Delivery roles + workflow checker + authority gate

**Goal.** Make the first governance phase real: author/import RFCs under a review protocol, with
the new org-chart roles and the deterministic engine that gates phase transitions.

- [x] 2.1 Add personas `agent/{product-manager,tech-lead,producer}.md` + the **domain-overlay**
      pattern (`agent/domains/<domain>/<role>.md`, e.g. the `game` `product-manager` = Game
      Designer); recursive `agent-registry` + `authority-personas` lints. **OQ4 resolved:** one
      authority role + a domain-specialized persona overlay (not two role IDs).
- [x] 2.2 RFC template + the **RFC-review protocol** under `orchestrator/os/rfc/` (schema +
      config + template + protocol), and `tools/rfc_check.py` enforcing the **`rfc-approved`** gate
      (required sections + a `tech-lead` approval record).
- [x] 2.3 The **deterministic workflow checker**: `phase_runner.py` returns the legal transitions
      and (new `--propose <to>`) validates a proposed transition and **emits the checkpoint** to
      write — read-only; the agent writes it, the human confirms H-gates.
- [x] 2.4 The **authority gate** — `tools/authority_check.py <role> <paths>` enforces the
      `authority.yaml` ownership map: a path the acting role may not write (outside its
      `owns`/`may_draft`) is rejected. Agent-invoked (CI can't know the actor's role), tested.
- [x] 2.5 Ship the **`/eados design`** command surface (`commands/design.md` — authority-check →
      author the RFC from the template → review → `rfc_check` → `phase_runner --propose plan`).

**Acceptance gate.** A sample RFC passes the review gate; an out-of-authority edit is rejected by
the authority gate; the checker computes the correct legal transitions for a given state.
**Depends on:** M1.

---

## Milestone 3 — `plan` phase: roadmap from RFCs + the traceability graph

**Goal.** Co-create the roadmap from RFCs through a real negotiation, and build the lineage graph
that makes delivery auditable.

- [x] 3.1 The **roadmap-negotiation protocol** under `orchestrator/os/plan/` (schema + `plan.yaml`
      config + `negotiation-protocol.md`): PM proposes → `tech-lead` sizes (T-shirt) → `producer`
      reconciles capacity, anchored to artifacts (no "multi-agent theatre").
- [x] 3.2 Ship the **`/eados plan`** command surface (`commands/plan.md` — negotiate via `plan.yaml`
      → write `ROADMAP.md` → `traceability.py` (`roadmap-covers-rfcs`) → `--propose scaffold`).
- [x] 3.3 The **traceability-graph builder** — `tools/traceability.py` builds the design-time
      `RFC → milestone` edges from the roadmap (the Git-side `PR → commit → release` edges land in
      M4, derived from the `git`-spec cross-links).
- [x] 3.4 The **`roadmap-covers-rfcs`** gate — `traceability.py` fails when an RFC is addressed by
      no milestone (every RFC maps to ≥1 milestone; generalizes the spec-coverage-map). Wired into
      `workflow.yaml`.

**Acceptance gate.** Every RFC maps to ≥1 milestone; the graph builds from a sample project's
cross-links.
**Depends on:** M2.

---

## Milestone 4 — `audit` phase: risk scoring + enforced `traceability-lint`

**Goal.** Stand up continuous audit with a real risk model, and turn the traceability graph into
a blocking gate.

- [x] 4.1 A **risk model** — `tools/risk_score.py` + the `risk` OS spec: score = f(security surface
      × change size × blast radius), generalizing the `reviewer` + `security-auditor` roles.
- [x] 4.2 Ship the **`/eados audit`** command surface (`commands/audit.md` — `traceability-lint` +
      `risk_score` → the `security-auditor` gate above threshold → a risk register).
- [x] 4.3 The **`traceability-lint`** gate — `traceability.py --links` extends the graph to the
      Git-side edges (`milestone → PR → commit → release`) and fails on a dangling edge (an RFC with
      no PR, a PR missing its RFC/milestone, a release not tracing to a PR + commit).
- [x] 4.4 Risk-threshold → **mandatory `security-auditor` gate** at/above the level; the threshold
      is **per-domain configurable** in `risk.yaml` (**OQ2 resolved**: a global default + domain override).

**Acceptance gate.** A seeded dangling edge fails `traceability-lint`; a change above the risk
threshold forces the security gate.
**Depends on:** M3.

---

## Milestone 5 — `refactor` (brownfield) — last, sandboxed

**Goal.** Bring an existing repository up to the standard via incremental, gated migrations —
the highest-risk phase (it edits real user code), so it is sequenced last and write-contained.

- [x] 5.1 **Brownfield reader** — `tools/brownfield.py` (READ-ONLY) maps an existing repo against
      the EADOS standard (agent contract, docs system, CI, source tree) and reports the gaps to migrate.
- [x] 5.2 **Migration planner** — `tools/migration_planner.py` (READ-ONLY) orders the brownfield
      gaps into incremental steps (one logical change each), lowest-risk / most-foundational first.
- [x] 5.3 A **write-contained sandbox** — `tools/sandbox.py` (defense-in-depth, on the renderer
      write-guard principle of [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-renderer-write-guards-and-validation-independence.md)):
      a write may only land inside the target repo (traversal/absolute/symlink/`.git`/clobber refused).
- [x] 5.4 Ship the **`/eados refactor`** command surface (`commands/refactor.md` — brownfield read
      → plan → sandboxed, gated, **additive** migration PRs, one logical change each).

**Acceptance gate.** A fixture repo is migrated via gated PRs; no write escapes the sandbox; each
PR passes the standard's gates.
**Depends on:** M4.

## Cross-cutting invariants (every PR, every milestone)

These are **not tasks to complete** but **invariants upheld in every PR** — held across M1–M5 and
binding on all future work (the v2.0.0 release included). They are deliberately not checkboxes.

- **English on disk; agent drafts / human merges & publishes; Conventional Commits; one logical
  change per PR; one PR at a time.**
- **Each new spec / role / domain ships `_schema`-validated and lint-gated** — never a special case
  in code (anti-fragmentation), enforced by `eados_lint`'s `os-spec-completeness`,
  `domain-completeness`, `authority-personas`, and `agent-registry` gates.
- **Each milestone keeps RFC-0001, this roadmap, the affected specs, and the `CHANGELOG` in sync in
  the same PR.**
