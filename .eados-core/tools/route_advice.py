"""EADOS model & effort routing advisor (M16 16.2) — the `os/routing` policy as a tool. Given a
unit of work's signals (tracker labels + asserted flags) it recommends a capability tier, an
effort level, and the current model for a host — by the spec's monotonic escalation: start at the
`defaults` floor, every matched rule raises to at least its `min_tier`/`min_effort`, final = max.
It recommends only; the human keeps final model authority (ADR-0017, AGENTS.md §6).

Everything is data-driven: the policy is `orchestrator/os/routing/routing.yaml`; model names come
from its dated `catalog:`, never from this file. The core (`advise`) is pure and fixture-tested;
the spec is loud-rejected on load when it breaks its own `_schema.md` invariants. Only the
optional `--issue N` / `--milestone T` fetches shell out to `gh`, degrading cleanly (clear
message, exit 2) when `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or offline — like `pr_review.py`.

    python .eados-core/tools/route_advice.py --labels "adr,severity:high" [--flags decision-heavy]
    python .eados-core/tools/route_advice.py --issue 247 [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--json]

    python .eados-core/tools/route_advice.py --labels "adr" --check --current-model "Opus 4.8"

The `--check` mode (M18 18.2) compares the resolved route against the model the session
self-reports (`--current-model`) and prints ROUTE-OK / ROUTE-MISMATCH — advisory, always exit 0;
it never switches the model (no host lets an agent re-route its own session — ADR-0017).

      * it belongs to a provider the host declares it reaches;
      * it is `assessed` (an unverified capability claim never routes work — #326);
      * its `meets_tier` is at or ABOVE the floor tier (meets-or-exceeds, not exact match);
      * its `max_effort`, where declared, admits the floor effort. An absent ceiling is
        unrecorded, not unlimited — it is treated as no constraint, which is how every other
        optional field in this catalog reads.

    Ordering — `selection.prefer`. `lowest_cost` applies only when EVERY candidate records a
    `relative_cost`: partial cost data cannot produce a fair ranking, and a model with a recorded
    cost of 100 must not outrank one whose cost is simply unknown. With cost unusable, the fallback
    is the tier ladder itself, which `tiers` declares as cheapest -> most capable — so the answer is
    the LEAST capable model that still clears the floor. That is "minimum sufficient model"
    computed rather than asserted (ADR-0024 D3). Remaining ties break on the host's provider order
    then declaration order, so the result never depends on a missing figure.
