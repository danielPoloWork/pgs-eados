"""EADOS refactor sandbox (roadmap 5.3) — write containment for the brownfield `refactor` phase.

The migration's edits are the only place EADOS touches *real user code*, so every write goes
through here. Defense-in-depth, on the same principle as the renderer's write guard
([ADR-0007](../docs/adr/0007-renderer-write-guards-and-validation-independence.md)):

  * a write may only land **inside the target repo root** (path-traversal is refused via
    realpath + commonpath — symlinks are resolved, so a symlink that points outside is caught);
  * absolute / drive-qualified destinations are refused outright;
  * writes into a `.git/` at **any** depth are refused — a nested or submodule `.git/` is VCS
    metadata too (never corrupt it);
  * **additive by default** — refusing to overwrite an existing file unless `overwrite=True` is
    passed explicitly (a migration *adds* missing artifacts; clobbering user code is a human call).

Each migration step is still one reviewable, gated PR; this is the mechanical backstop underneath.
Dependency-free (Python standard library only).
