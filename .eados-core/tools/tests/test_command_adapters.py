"""Tests for the command-adapters self-lint check (#239, ADR-0019 class 4) —
eados_lint.command_adapter_problems.

Every AVAILABLE `/eados <name>` row of orchestrator/commands/README.md must ship its Claude Code
adapter at .claude/commands/eados/<name>.md, and the adapter must POINT at the row's own canonical
procedure (never copy it). Symmetric: an orphan adapter with no available row is stale. These pin
the pure helper off in-memory fixtures plus the live factory tree. Dependency-free.
