"""Negative-path tests for the renderer's guards — they must FAIL on bad input.

The render-smoke proves the *happy path* (the reference manifest renders cleanly). This proves
the inverse, which is where the security/correctness value lives: a path-unsafe identifier, a
missing required field, an unknown section, or a bad version must each be a hard failure, and a
write can never escape --out. Dependency-free (no PyYAML): runnable in the self-lint job.
