"""EADOS end-to-end phase-flow smoke (roadmap 6.1 / G4).

The per-tool unit tests (`test_rfc_check`, `test_traceability`, `test_risk_score`,
`test_phase_runner`, ...) each exercise *one* tool in isolation, with hand-built strings. They
cannot catch a bug at the **seams between tools** — the integration the delivery pipeline depends
on: that a single coherent fixture project flows through `design -> plan -> audit` with every gate
agreeing on the *same* RFC ids, milestone, and links, and that the phase runner's view of the
state machine matches what `workflow.yaml` declares.

This smoke threads ONE fixture project (manifest + RFC + ROADMAP + links) through the real phase
tool chain by invoking each tool's **actual CLI** via subprocess — exactly how an agent (or CI)
runs a phase — and asserts:

  * the gate tools **pass** on the good fixture (the artifacts a real phase produces satisfy them);
  * each gate **fails** (non-zero exit) on a deliberately broken fixture (the gate truly gates —
    a smoke that only walks the happy path proves nothing);
  * for **every** transition declared in `workflow.yaml`, `phase_runner --propose` reports it LEGAL
    and lists that transition's entry gates, and an *undeclared* move is rejected ILLEGAL — the
    flow is data-driven from the spec, so it follows the workflow without a hardcoded copy;
  * every entry gate names a registered gate whose backing tool exists on disk — tying the
    workflow spec to the real toolchain (a renamed tool or typo'd gate id breaks the flow but
    passes every unit test).

Dependency-free (stdlib + the sibling renderer's YAML loader), so it runs in the self-lint job.
