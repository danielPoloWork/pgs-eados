"""Regression test for autotune's majority logic.

autotune proposes a default change only when one value is the majority across run records.
A key overridden twice WITHIN a single record must not inflate its count past the number of
records (a false majority). This pins that, plus the genuine cross-record majority. Reuses
render.load_yaml; dependency-free.
