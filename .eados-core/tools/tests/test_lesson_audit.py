"""Tests for lesson_audit (#173) — the learning-loop watchdog behind generate.md's Recall/Record.

Pure-core fixtures: a seeded repeat failure reports a regression naming the lesson id (in scope
only); an unused lesson is flagged dead only after enough *applicable* runs; a dimension scoring
low in the majority of runs yields a trend proposal. The textual ledger parser is pinned against
the REAL lessons.yaml, and a main() integration proves the report is report-only (exit 0) over
records emitted by record_run's own loader-safe emitter. Dependency-free.
