"""Issue #250 — git_check.py, the deterministic evaluator for the os/git/git.yaml policy.
Pins the pure helpers (branch naming, Conventional-Commit shape) against the REAL policy data
(never a synthetic copy — the tool's whole point is that the policy is data), the exemptions
(default branch, merge commits), and the CLI overrides. Dependency-free; gh-dependent one-PR
counting is exercised only through its SKIP degradation (no network in tests).
