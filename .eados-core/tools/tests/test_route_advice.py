"""Tests for route_advice (M16 16.2) — the routing-policy evaluator core, on an in-memory fixture
spec AND the real shipped `os/routing/routing.yaml`. Exercises monotonic escalation (floor, raises,
order-independence), the loud rejection of a spec that breaks its own `_schema.md` invariants
(unknown tier/effort/flag, a host missing a tier), host/catalog resolution, effort-alias
normalization, and the advisory boundary. The `gh` shell is not touched. Dependency-free.

    # case became an unknown-model. Both stayed green while testing nothing. So: derive the models

    # reshuffle turns these red instead of quiet.

    # developer box it detects claude-code, on a CI runner it resolves to nothing and there are no
