"""git_check — the deterministic evaluator for the `os/git/git.yaml` policy (#250).

`git.yaml` declares the branch / commit / one-PR policy as data, but until now NO tool evaluated
it: branch naming, Conventional-Commit shape, and one-PR-at-a-time were advisory prose — the
honor system this issue closes. This tool reads the policy AS DATA (never hardcoded) and checks:

  * **branch**  — the current branch matches `<type>/<short-kebab>` with a declared type
                  (the default branch itself is exempt: the human lives there; agents branch);
  * **commit**  — HEAD's subject is a Conventional Commit: `type(scope): subject`, declared
                  type, declared scope when present, subject <= 72 chars (merge commits and the
                  bootstrap root are exempt — they are not authored change subjects);
  * **one-PR**  — at most one open PR (git.yaml `commit.one_pr_at_a_time`), via `gh`; no `gh`
                  (or no network) degrades to SKIP — offline work must not fail on a courtesy
                  check it cannot perform.

PR *metadata* (assignee / one type label / milestone) stays `pr_metadata_check.py`'s job — this
tool checks what is knowable from git alone plus the one-PR count. Registered in workflow.yaml
as the cross-cutting `git-policy` gate (`wired: external`, like `traceability-lint`): the agent
runs it pre-PR, CI may gate on it; `--advisory` reports without failing the exit code (the
"advisory locally, gating in CI" split is the caller's flag, not two tools).

**Whose policy?** (#358) The policy is *discovered*, not hardcoded. In a **generated** repo it is
that repo's own `docs/workflow/git-policy.yaml`, rendered from its manifest; in **EADOS itself** it
is `os/git/git.yaml`; in a repo that has neither, the check narrows to what is identical in every
EADOS contract and **says so** rather than borrowing someone else's scope list. This tool used to
read the factory spec unconditionally, so after `scaffold` it judged a project's commits against
EADOS's own scopes — rejecting the project's valid ones and, more quietly, accepting scopes it had
never declared.

    The bug this replaces (#358) was not a wrong path but an unaskable question: `GIT_POLICY` was
    hardcoded and `main()` exposed no way to change it, so after `scaffold` handed governance to a
    generated repo's own `AGENTS.md`, this tool still judged that repo's commits against **EADOS's**
    scope list. On a real consumer the two lists overlapped in 2 of 13 entries — it rejected 11 valid
    project scopes and would have waved through `fix(profiles):` in a Java library that has neither.

    The ladder, and the reason each rung exists:

      1. `--policy PATH` — an explicit answer always wins.
      2. `<repo>/docs/workflow/git-policy.yaml` — the generated repo's own, rendered from its
         manifest. First, because in a consumer repo the vendored `.eados-core/` is present and its
         factory spec is exactly the wrong answer.
      3. the factory's `os/git/git.yaml`, **only** when `<repo>` is EADOS itself (`.eados-dev`).
         Gated rather than used as a fallback: an ungated fallback is the original defect.
      4. nothing. Repos generated before this shipped have no rendered policy and are never
         re-rendered (ADR-0003), so this is a permanent, expected state — not an error."""
