"""EADOS phase runner — the deterministic, state-driven checker behind `/eados <phase>`.

Given a project manifest, it reads `delivery_state.phase` and the workflow spec
(`orchestrator/os/workflow/workflow.yaml`) and prints the **legal next transitions** — each with
its entry gates and whether it needs human confirmation. It is the thin "engine" the RFC calls
for: a pure function over data. It **never advances state** — it reports what is legal; the agent
proposes a transition, the gates validate it, and the human confirms every human-gated step
(`AGENTS.md` §6).

At every boundary it re-grounds the runtime non-negotiables (#221) — the acting role, the terminal
human gate, one-PR — each line derived from the workflow / authority / git specs, so a long run can
no longer let them drift out of view. Past a checkpoint-depth threshold it adds a compact reminder.

Dependency-free: the Python standard library plus the sibling renderer's YAML loader.
