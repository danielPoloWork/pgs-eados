"""lesson_audit — the "never make the same mistake twice" watchdog (#173, M13).

The auto-tuner ([`autotune.py`](autotune.py)) mines run records for *defaults* to change;
this tool mines the same records for the *learning loop's* health and reports three things
— report-only, like autotune, and for the same reasons (versioned data, reviewable proposal,
a human applies it). It never edits anything.

    python .eados-core/tools/lesson_audit.py [--threshold N]

1. **Regression detection.** A run record whose `failures` share keywords with a lesson the
   run was in scope for means the factory violated its own recorded knowledge. Per the
   escalation path (*incident → lesson → gate → meta-gate*) that is the trigger to promote the
   advisory lesson to a mechanical gate.
2. **Dead-lesson report.** A lesson never present in any `lessons_applied` across at least
   `--threshold` runs it was *applicable* to is flagged as dead weight for owner review.
3. **Rubric trending.** A rubric dimension scoring ≤ 1 in the majority of the runs that scored
   it proposes drafting a lesson / filing a factory issue — this mechanizes `eval/rubric.md`
   §4, which today asks the agent to notice recurring low scores from memory alone.

Dependency-free: reuses render.py's YAML loader for the records and record_run.py's canonical
rubric-dimension list, and parses the lessons ledger textually (its root is a YAML sequence,
outside the minimal loader's subset — the same approach as eados_lint's check_lessons).
