"""Structural self-review of a generated repository (beyond the congruence lint).

Dependency-free. Run against a rendered repo:

    python .eaao-core/tools/self_review.py <path-to-generated-repo>

consistency_lint.py proves the generated repo is internally *congruent*; this proves it is
*complete* — every governance file, doc subsystem, and GitHub artifact the enterprise bar
expects is actually present, the ROADMAP has its required sections, and no {{PLACEHOLDER}}
leaked through. It is the mechanical half of eval/rubric.md (the human/agent scores the rest).

Exit non-zero if any REQUIRED item is missing or a stray placeholder is found; capability-gated
items (i18n, announcements) are checked only if present.
